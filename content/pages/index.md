      I am a techie, who loves to scribble. This blog is a thought experiment.


      These blogs have an unadulterated view of my mind. I don't review them, I
      don't rephrase them, I just write it once and publish. The basic spell
      check and grammar check are taken care of by squiggly lines.


      Oftentimes, when I come back to a post a few days after it has been
      published, it is a refreshing experience.


      The post has captured the exact frame of my mind rather than refined
      thoughts. The resulting dissonance is the thought experiment.
